# 2D-SpaceShooter
2D SpaceShooter base on the skeleton of my 2D platform game (Java exercise)

TO DO
-----
- Urgent:
- Change the Comparator renderSorter (it crash with too many creatures(entities?) on screen (not actually possible to have too many creatures on screen))
*improve spawnEngine (the check of empty space, etc)

- Medium:
*Menu (at least Play button working)
*create coin item to be able to upgrade your ship
*"Inventory" (Upgrades)

- Light:
*Upgrades system(?) (probably not needed)
*implements more enemy ships
*implements more user ships
